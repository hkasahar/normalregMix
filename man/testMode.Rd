\description{
Turns on/off the test mode.

When the modified EM-algorithm is run, initial values are randomly created
based on the data given. If the test mode is turned on, these initial values
are going to be created with the random seed provided. This method would be suitable
for users who would like to replicate experiments. By default, the test mode is turned off.
